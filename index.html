                Tim Berners-Lee, in full Sir Tim Berners-Lee, (born June 8, 1955, London, England), 
                British computer scientist, generally credited as the inventor of the World Wide Web. 
                In 2004 he was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and 
                the inaugural Millennium Technology Prize (â‚¬1 million) by the Finnish Technology Award Foundation.

                Computing came naturally to Berners-Lee, as both of his parents worked on the Ferranti Mark I, 
                the first commercial computer. (See computer: The first stored-program machines.) 
                After graduating in 1976 from the University of Oxford, 
                Berners-Lee designed computer software for two years at Plessey Telecommunications Ltd., 
                located in Poole, Dorset, England. Following this, he had several positions in the computer industry, 
                including a stint from June to December 1980 as a software engineering consultant at CERN, 
                the European particle physics laboratory in Geneva.
